## About Me
Welcome to my personal data science portfolio website. My name is Jackson Yang and I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington with a bachelor's degree in **Business Administration and Information Systems**. I am currently enrolled in the **Master of Quantitative Management: Business Analytics** program at Duke Fuqua, where I am learning to utilize data analytics to solve real-world business problems. With my background in both business and data science, I am well-equipped to navigate the intersection of these fields and drive data-driven decision making in organizations.

- In the **Projects** section of this website, you will find a selection of interesting data science projects that I have completed in recent years. These projects are presented in iPython notebooks, SQL, or R markdown files for easy reference and review. Each project highlights my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving, and demonstrates my ability to apply these skills to real-world scenarios.
- In the **Micro Projects** section, I highlighted the projects that demonstrate my programming abilities and data science expertise, such as SQL, data vivsualization, etc.
