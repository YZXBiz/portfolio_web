  <h3>Self Check-Out Fraud Detection (Python)</h3>
  <p>
    Self-checkout systems in retail stores offer convenience for customers, but can also leave retailers vulnerable to fraud if not properly monitored. A fraud detection model can help retailers identify suspicious activity and target certain purchases for additional scrutiny in order to prevent abuse and loss. In this project, we aim to minimize the number of checks performed to avoid unnecessary expenses and prevent falsely accusing innocent customers and causing them inconvenience.

                        <h3>Customer Conversion Rate Analysis (Python)</h3>
                        <p>
Conversion rate analysis can help businesses identify opportunities for growth. By identifying segments of the market that are more or less likely to convert, businesses can identify areas where they can focus their efforts in order to drive growth. In this project, we looked into a customer conversion dataset and help company increase the likelihood that their marketing and sales efforts will be successful.

                        <p>
Funnel analysis helps understand the customer path and enhance conversions. Businesses may learn where users are sliding off a sales or conversion funnel by tracking their progress. This data can be utilized to optimize the funnel and improve conversion rates, boosting sales and income. In this project, we'll analyze a company's conversion funnel to discover bottlenecks and optimize the customer journey.
